Based on building block properties, we have defined accessible topology maps, which give an idea of what cage topology you are likely to get after self-assembly:

This is a simple interface where you can map the angles and building block connectivities of interest to stable topologies.

This covers ditopic + tritopic, ditopic + tetratopic and tritopic + tetratopic cage topologies.
