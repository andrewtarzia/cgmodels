Exploring self-sorting outcomes and topology maps in cage-like molecules.

Publication: `Systematic exploration of accessible topologies of cage molecules via minimalistic models <https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/sc/d3sc03991a>`_

Based on building block properties, we have defined accessible topology maps, which give an idea of what cage topology you are likely to get after self-assembly:

For helping with this, I must thank G. Fraux (@Luthaf), M. Ceriotti and the
Cerrioti group. Here is a link to their paper on
`chemiscope <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02117>`_.

Notion database

This is a simple interface where you can map the angles and building block connectivities of interest to stable topologies.

This covers ditopic + tritopic, ditopic + tetratopic and tritopic + tetratopic cage topologies.
