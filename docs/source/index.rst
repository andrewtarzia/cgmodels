   Model dataset 1 <cg_model_jul2023.rst>


============
Introduction
============

| GitHub: https://github.com/andrewtarzia/cgmodels


Overview
========

In this repository, I host the toy and coarse-grained models
I have developed over the years.

Everything shown here is built with a combination of:

* `cgexplore <https://cgexplore.readthedocs.io>`_

* `stk <https://stk.readthedocs.io>`_

* `stko <https://stko-docs.readthedocs.io>`_

* `SpinDry <https://spindry.readthedocs.io>`_

* `OpenMM <https://openmm.org/>`_


Publications
============


* Model dataset 1 (July 2023): `Systematic exploration of accessible topologies of cage molecules via minimalistic models`__

Plans for a web-app
===================

This setup was organised relatively quickly. However, the computational models used in this research are so cheap that on-the-fly calculations are possible in a web backend. This would allow users to supply their inputs and have the models run immediately.
