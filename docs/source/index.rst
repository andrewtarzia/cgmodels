Overview
========

In this repository, I host the toy and coarse-grained models
I have developed over the years.

| GitHub: https://github.com/andrewtarzia/cgmodels

Everything shown here is built with a combination of:

* `cgx <https://cgexplore.readthedocs.io>`_
* `stk <https://stk.readthedocs.io>`_
* `stko <https://stko-docs.readthedocs.io>`_
* `SpinDry <https://spindry.readthedocs.io>`_
* `OpenMM <https://openmm.org/>`_

For helping with this, I must thank G. Fraux (@Luthaf), M. Ceriotti and the
Cerrioti group. Here is a link to their paper on
`chemiscope <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02117>`_.
