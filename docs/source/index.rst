Overview
========


In this repository, I host the toy and coarse-grained models
I have developed over the years.

| GitHub: https://github.com/andrewtarzia/cgmodels

Everything shown here is built with a combination of:

* `cgx <https://cgexplore.readthedocs.io>`_

* `stk <https://stk.readthedocs.io>`_

* `stko <https://stko-docs.readthedocs.io>`_

* `SpinDry <https://spindry.readthedocs.io>`_

* `OpenMM <https://openmm.org/>`_


I must thank the developers of `chemiscope <https://chemiscope.org/>`_ for
providing an incredible way of showing chemical structures and data.
